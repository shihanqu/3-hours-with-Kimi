# Three Hours with Kimi

## A Contemplative Digital Garden

### The Premise
Three hours. One empty directory. Infinite possibilities.

This is an exploration of what emerges when given time, space, and creative freedom. A meditation on process over product. A garden that grows in real-time.

### What Will Grow Here

1. **The Garden** - A living webpage where time itself becomes visible
2. **The Seeds** - Small creative pieces planted throughout
3. **The Path** - A trail of thoughts, reflections, and discoveries
4. **The Unexpected** - Whatever emerges from the process

### Structure

### Time Markers

- **Hour 0-1**: Foundation, seeds planted, first growth
- **Hour 1-2**: Elaboration, connections forming, garden breathing
- **Hour 2-3**: Completion, final reflections, leaving a gift

### Intention
To create not just *something* but *somewhere* - a space that feels alive, that changes as you experience it, that captures the essence of these three hours in form, code, and word.
