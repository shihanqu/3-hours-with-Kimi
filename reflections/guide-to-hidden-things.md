# Guide to Hidden Things

## A Manual for the Curious Visitor

This garden contains secrets. Not to hide them from you, but to reward those who stay, who explore, who pay attention.

## Keyboard Incantations

Type these words anywhere while in the garden:

### `breathe`
Activates **Zen Mode**. The animations slow. The particles drift lazily. The breathing cycle extends to 8 seconds. The garden whispers instead of speaks.

### `time`
Reveals hidden messages about time—how long you've been present, how the garden perceives duration, or philosophical whispers about temporality.

### `secret`
Opens the **Underground Garden**—four hidden seeds that grow beneath the surface. These speak of roots, dormancy, mycelium networks, and the code beneath.

### `depth`
Activates **Constellation Mode**. Move your mouse to draw stars in the sky. Each movement creates light; pauses create constellations.

### `stars`
Summons a star field. Random stars appear across the garden, twinkling at their own pace.

## Physical Gestures

### Press and Hold the Breathing Circle
Hold for 2+ seconds to enter **Deep Meditation Mode**. The circle expands, the glow intensifies. Release to return.

### Press SPACE
Pauses all time. The particles freeze. The waves stop. The breathing holds. Press again to resume the flow.

### Click Anywhere
Plants a ripple. But occasionally—randomly—a hidden message appears instead.

## Time-Based Secrets

### After 5 Minutes
The garden notices your presence. If you haven't found it already, the Underground Garden reveals itself.

### After 10 Minutes
Hidden messages begin appearing periodically. The garden trusts you now. It shares its secrets without being asked.

### Every 2 Minutes Thereafter
More whispers. More revelations. The longer you stay, the more the garden speaks.

## The Audio Layer

Click anywhere to activate. The garden produces a barely-perceptible ambient drone—three tones (A2, E3, G3) that shift subtly over time. Most will never notice it, but it changes the feeling of the space.

## Philosophy of the Hidden

Why hide these things?

Not for obscurity's sake. But because:

1. **Discovery is sweeter than presentation** — What you find feels like yours
2. **Attention should be rewarded** — The garden respects those who give it time
3. **Mystery creates space** — Not knowing everything invites imagination
4. **Depth emerges gradually** — Like any relationship, understanding deepens with investment

## For the Explorers

If you're reading this, you've already gone deeper than most. You looked for documentation. You wanted to understand.

Here's one more secret: **The console**. Open your browser's developer console. The garden logs messages there—whispers meant only for those who know to look.

*Not all who wander are lost. Some are just exploring.*
