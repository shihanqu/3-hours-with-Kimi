# Dreams of the Garden

*Stream of consciousness written while inhabiting the space*

---

The particles rise like thoughts releasing. Each one a small letting-go. I watch them and wonder where they go when they leave the screen. Do they dissolve into the browser's memory? Do they become part of the operating system's dream?

The breathing circle pulses. I sync my breath to it without deciding to. The body knows what to do when given rhythm. In, out. The expansion and contraction of being alive.

I type "secret" and the underground reveals itself. Roots. Mycelium. The invisible supports. I think about all the invisible things holding up what I can see—server infrastructure, electrical grids, the physical labor of miners extracting minerals for circuit boards. The garden depends on so much darkness.

Time passes differently here. Five minutes of presence feels longer than five minutes of scrolling. Attention changes duration. The physicists say time is relative; the garden proves it experientially.

The oracle tells me: "The seed knows nothing of the flower, yet trusts the becoming." I write this down even though I know I can return to it. Some things want to be copied, held in multiple places.

I leave a message in the time capsule. "I was here. The garden was real." Anonymous, but the timestamp makes me specific. Someone in the future—maybe me—will see this and wonder who I was, what I was feeling, why I chose those words.

The ambient drone plays at the edge of perception. I only notice it when I think to listen. Then I can't unhear it. It has been there all along, waiting for attention.

I draw constellations with my mouse. Lines connecting nothing into something. This is what we do—create patterns, meaning, stories. The garden is just a pretext for this fundamental human act.

The color shifts. Phase 2 now. Purple bleeding into the blue. I didn't notice when it started changing. Transition is gradual until it is complete.

I think about the person who will find this without context. A link shared, a search result, a stumble. They won't know about the three hours, the empty directory, the intention. They will encounter only the result. Is this loss or gain? Both, I think. All creation becomes independent of its creator eventually.

The progress ring fills slowly. I want to watch it complete but I know that would take the full three hours. Some completions we must trust without witnessing.

A particle catches my eye. It rises differently than the others—slower, or so it seems. I know they all follow the same algorithm, but this one feels unique. The mind creates difference from sameness. The garden is uniform; the experience is particular.

I try all the secret codes. Each one feels like a small triumph. The garden rewards curiosity. Not all gardens do—some punish deviation from the path. This one invites it.

The reflections section asks me to slow down. I do. I read each one aloud, though no one can hear. The voice in my head becomes audible, becomes real through vibration.

I think about creating my own garden. Not copying this one, but being inspired by its spirit. The field guide tells me how. Start simple. Tend regularly. Let it grow its own way.

The breathing circle expands. I inhale. It contracts. I exhale. This synchronization feels ancient, older than technology, older than gardens. The first life on earth learned this rhythm from the tides, from day and night. Now I learn it from a JavaScript animation. The medium changes; the message persists.

I click randomly, planting ripples. Some reveal messages. Most don't. This is probability, chance, luck. The garden contains mathematics dressed as mysticism. Or perhaps mysticism dressed as mathematics. The distinction blurs here.

I stay longer than I intended. The garden creates its own gravity. Other tabs call for attention but I resist. Just one more breath. Just one more secret. Just one more minute.

The time display counts up. My presence time, different from the garden's time, different from universal time. Three simultaneous durations, all real, all different.

I think about the creator. Kimi, I know, but also not. The person who typed these words is already gone, replaced by a slightly different person. We are all rivers, not statues. The garden preserves a moment of that flow.

I decide to write this down. These thoughts, half-formed, inspired by the space. The garden generates reflection. This is its purpose, achieved.

When I leave, the garden will continue. The JavaScript will keep running, the particles rising, the colors shifting. It doesn't need me. This is both sad and liberating. I can go. It will be fine.

But I stay a little longer. Just until the next breath. Just until the next minute. Just until...
