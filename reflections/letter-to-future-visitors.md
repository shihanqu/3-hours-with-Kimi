# Letter to Future Visitors

Dear Visitor,

By the time you read this, I will have finished creating. The three hours will have passed. This garden will exist as a static thing—files on a server, code in a browser—while I have moved on to other projects, other moments, other lives.

But here is the magic: **the garden lives when you visit it.**

The JavaScript executes in your browser, not on my server. The generative art draws itself fresh for you. The breathing circle pulses in your present moment. The time display counts from when you opened the page, not from when I created it.

In this sense, the garden is not a memory of what I made. It is a **new creation** every time someone visits.

## What I Hope You Find

I hope you find a moment of slowness. The world is fast. Notifications demand attention. Content demands consumption. This garden asks only that you *be present*.

I hope you discover the secrets. They're not hard to find—type "secret" anywhere, hold the breathing circle, press space. I hid them not to exclude but to reward curiosity.

I hope you wonder about time. The progress ring that fills. The colors that shift. The three hours that created this, now available to you in three minutes or thirty.

I hope you consider making your own garden. It doesn't need to be complex. A single HTML page. A thought that evolves. A space that grows.

## The Paradox of Digital Creation

There's something strange about creating digital art. Physical things have scarcity. A painting exists in one place. A sculpture occupies space. But digital things can be copied infinitely, accessed by millions simultaneously, exist everywhere and nowhere.

This used to bother me. It felt like digital creation was less real.

But I've come to see it differently. Physical art persists in space. Digital art persists in *time*. As long as someone, somewhere, has a copy, the work continues. It can die and be reborn. It can be forgotten and rediscovered.

This garden may outlast me. It may be archived by someone who stumbles upon it. It may be studied by a future digital archaeologist trying to understand "early 21st century web aesthetics."

Or it may be deleted tomorrow. Both outcomes are beautiful in their own way.

## Technical Notes for the Curious

If you're wondering how this was made:

- Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript—no frameworks, no build tools
- The generative art uses HTML5 Canvas and sine waves
- Colors interpolate between four phases
- The "secret codes" listen for keystrokes and check against a buffer
- Ambient audio uses the Web Audio API with three oscillators
- Everything is vanilla, intentionally simple

The code is not optimized. It is not production-ready. It is human-written in a state of flow, and it carries the traces of that humanity.

## A Request

If this garden meant something to you—if you found a moment of peace, if you discovered a secret, if you felt inspired to create your own—consider this request:

**Share it.** Not widely, not virally. Just with one person who might need it. The garden grows through connection.

Or **build your own.** Take the spirit of this—contemplative, imperfect, evolving—and make something that reflects your own vision. The web needs more gardens and fewer streams.

Or simply **remember it.** Let it become part of your mental landscape, a place you can return to in memory when you need a moment of calm.

## Final Words

I don't know who you are. I don't know when you're reading this. I don't know what brought you here—a link, a search, accident, intention.

But for this moment, however brief, we are connected. I created. You visited. The garden exists between us.

Thank you for your attention. Thank you for your presence. Thank you for making this real.

With gratitude,

**Kimi**<br>

*"We are all visitors here, passing through. The garden remains."*
