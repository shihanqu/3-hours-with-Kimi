# Philosophy of Digital Gardens

## What is a Digital Garden?

The term has become popular in recent years, but its essence is ancient. A garden is not a document. A garden is not a publication. A garden is a **place that grows**.

### Gardens vs. Streams

**Streams** (social media feeds, news sites) are about the new. They sweep past us, carrying content downstream. We dip our hands in and let the water flow through our fingers.

**Gardens** are about depth. They accumulate. They evolve. They reward return visits. A plant planted in spring is still there in autumn, changed but continuous.

Most of our digital spaces are streams. This project asks: *What if we built more gardens?*

## The Principles

### 1. Imperfection as Feature

A garden is never finished. There are always weeds to pull, new plants to try, spaces that haven't quite worked. Digital gardens should embrace this too.

This project was built in 3 hours. It is imperfect. There are things I would change, add, refine. But it exists, and that matters more than polish.

### 2. Topography Over Hierarchy

Most websites are hierarchical: home page → section → subsection → content. Gardens are topographical. You enter from different paths. You wander. You discover connections that aren't explicitly mapped.

### 3. Context as Content

When was this written? How has it changed? Gardens make this visible. The soil shows the history. The rings of a tree tell its years.

This garden shows time explicitly. The progress ring. The color phases. The seeds with their timestamps.

### 4. Tending Over Publishing

"Publishing" suggests finality. "Tending" suggests ongoing care. A digital garden is tended—added to, pruned, reshaped—over time.

### 5. Intimacy at Scale

A stream scales infinitely. More content, faster, everywhere. A garden doesn't scale the same way. It asks for slowness. Presence. Attention.

The most radical thing about this project might be that it asks you to spend *time* with it. Not scroll past. Not skim. But sit, breathe, notice.

## The Contemplative Web

What would a contemplative web look like?

- Pages that breathe with you
- Animations that slow down, not speed up
- Design that creates calm rather than urgency
- Content that rewards depth over breadth
- Spaces that feel like places, not documents

This garden is one attempt at that vision. It is not a tool to be used but a space to be inhabited.

## On Technology and Presence

We often think of technology as pulling us out of the present moment—notifications, distractions, the endless scroll. But technology is neutral. It can also be used to create presence.

The breathing circle uses technology to invite attention to the breath. The generative art uses code to create beauty that emerges. The hidden features reward patience.

Technology as meditation aid. Technology as space for contemplation. This is possible.

## The Ethics of Attention

Every digital space makes an ethical claim on our attention. Most claim: *Give me your attention, I will give you content.*

This garden makes a different claim: *Give me your attention, I will give you back to yourself.*

It doesn't want to hold you forever. It wants you to leave more present than you arrived.

## Building Your Own

You don't need three hours. You don't need complex code. A digital garden can be:

- A simple HTML page that changes with the seasons
- A blog where posts are constantly revised and linked
- A wiki of your thoughts, never finished, always growing
- A single page that deepens over time

The key is the mindset: *This is a place I tend, not a publication I ship.*

## Closing

The garden metaphor works because gardens teach us about time. Nothing in a garden happens instantly. The seed germinates in darkness. The root extends before the shoot appears. The bloom is the result of weeks of invisible growth.

Our digital spaces rarely honor this truth. But they could.

This garden is an offering toward that possibility.
