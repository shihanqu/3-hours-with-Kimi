# Field Guide to the Garden

*A taxonomical exploration of digital flora*

---

## Annuals (Visible on Every Visit)

### *Tempus ringus* (The Progress Ring)
**Family:** Chronometridae

A circular specimen that fills gradually over three hours. The rate of filling is constant, but observers perceive it differently—slow at first, then increasingly significant as completion nears.

**Identification:** Metallic gold stroke, 283 unit circumference, fills clockwise from top.

**Habitat:** Center of entrance area, highly visible.

**Behavior:** Never stops moving, yet never seems to hurry. A meditation on duration made visible.

---

### *Particula ascendens* (The Rising Seeds)
**Family:** Aerofloridae

Tiny points of light that drift upward like seeds on wind. Each particle follows a unique trajectory, yet all move in the same general direction.

**Identification:** 2px diameter, amber colored, opacity varies with altitude.

**Habitat:** Full viewport, originating from bottom edge.

**Behavior:** Continuous generation and dissolution. Each particle exists for 15-25 seconds before fading at the top of the screen.

**Note:** In Zen Mode (*breathe* activated), particles move at half speed, creating a dreamlike atmosphere.

---

### *Sinus undulatus* (The Flowing Lines)
**Family:** Geometridae

Mathematical curves drawn on canvas, representing the passage of time through pure sine waves. The lines never repeat exactly.

**Identification:** Thin amber strokes, varying opacity, wave-like patterns.

**Habitat:** Background canvas, full width.

**Behavior:** Generated by algorithm: `y = center + sin(x + time) * amplitude`. Five parallel specimens create harmonic patterns.

---

## Perennials (Persistent Structures)

### *Semina verbum* (The Seven Seeds)
**Family:** Narratividae

Seven distinct content cards, each representing a phase of creation. They do not change, yet reveal more with each viewing.

**Identification:** Glass morphism containers, rounded corners, contain text and timestamps.

**Habitat:** Grid formation in Seeds section.

**Members:**
1. *S. emptypage* — The beginning
2. *S. intention* — Structure
3. *S. form* — Growth
4. *S. breath* — Pause
5. *S. bloom* — Surprise
6. *S. integration* — Unity
7. *S. gift* — Completion

---

### *Reflectio scripta* (The Reflections)
**Family:** Memoriae

Written thoughts from the creation process, preserved like pressed flowers. Each carries a timestamp from the original three hours.

**Identification:** Left-border accent, serif typography, italicized prose.

**Habitat:** Vertical stack, chronological order.

**Note:** These are the most human elements—direct traces of thought during creation.

---

### *Circulus respirans* (The Breathing Circle)
**Family:** Meditativae

The garden's emotional center. Expands and contracts in 4-second cycles (8 seconds in Zen Mode), inviting synchronization.

**Identification:** 200px diameter, amber border, concentric rings.

**Habitat:** Contemplation space, center stage.

**Behavior:** Inhale (expand, glow intensifies), exhale (contract, glow softens). Can be paused by click, intensified by holding.

**Interaction:** Long hold (2+ seconds) triggers Deep Meditation Mode.

---

## Subterranean Species (Hidden Below)

### *Radix secretum* (The Underground Seeds)
**Family:** Occultidae

Four seeds invisible on first arrival. Revealed by typing 'secret' or remaining present for 5 minutes.

**Identification:** Similar to *Semina verbum* but with purple/violet accent colors.

**Habitat:** Below visible seeds, initially hidden.

**Members:**
1. *R. underground* — On invisible growth
2. *R. dormancy* — On patience
3. *R. mycelium* — On connection
4. *R. codebeneath* — On layers

---

### *Mycelia conexus* (The Constellation Threads)
**Family:** Networkae

Appears only in Constellation Mode (*depth* activated). Lines connecting mouse movements, drawn in real-time.

**Identification:** Thin lines, low opacity, temporary existence.

**Habitat:** Canvas layer, triggered by mouse movement.

**Behavior:** Fades after 2 seconds. Creates unique patterns with each visitor's movement.

---

## Bioluminescent Species (Light-Producers)

### *Stella cadens* (The Falling Stars)
**Family:** Astralidae

Appears when 'stars' is typed. Random twinkling points across the viewport.

**Identification:** White, 2-5px diameter, varying opacity.

**Habitat:** Full viewport, z-index: 1.

**Behavior:** Twinkle animation, random intervals, infinite duration.

---

### *Unda clickis* (The Click Ripples)
**Family:** Eventidae

Brief expansions triggered by clicking empty space. Exist for only one second.

**Identification:** Expanding circles, amber border, no fill.

**Habitat:** Location of click, fixed position.

**Behavior:** Expands from 20px to 100px while fading to transparent.

**Note:** 5% chance of triggering hidden message instead of visual ripple.

---

## Symbiotic Systems

### *Oraculum responsum* (The Oracle)
**Family:** Divinatoriae

Not a plant but a system—crystalline structure that responds to questions with metaphorical answers.

**Habitat:** Separate page (*oracle.html*).

**Behavior:** Listens (pulse animation), processes (2-second delay), responds (text revelation).

**Repertoire:** 20 metaphorical responses, selected by hashing the question.

---

### *Capsula temporis* (The Time Capsule)
**Family:** Memoriae collectivae

Container for visitor messages. Messages persist in local browser memory.

**Habitat:** Separate page (*capsule.html*).

**Components:**
- Input fields (author, message)
- Seed selector (emoji markers)
- Display area (chronological list)

**Capacity:** 20 most recent messages.

---

### *Ritualis practica* (The Rituals)
**Family:** Ceremonialidae

Four distinct interactive practices for presence.

**Habitat:** Separate page (*rituals.html*).

**Members:**
1. *R. threebreaths* — Breathing synchrony
2. *R. mantra* — Random phrase reception
3. *R. gratitude* — Written appreciation
4. *R. grounding* — Sensory awareness (5-4-3-2-1)

---

## Seasonal Variations (Themes)

The garden can shift between color palettes, like seasons:

### *Thema aurora* (Dawn)
Default. Amber on deep blue. Warmth emerging from darkness.

### *Thema sylvestris* (Forest)
Emerald on deep green. Patience of trees.

### *Thema oceanus* (Ocean)
Cyan on navy. Rhythmic depth.

### *Thema bacca* (Berry)
Magenta on purple. Hidden sweetness.

### *Thema nebula* (Mist)
Silver on gray. Soft obscurity.

### *Thema ignis* (Flame)
Red on burgundy. Transformative energy.

---

## Rare Phenomena

### *Messagium latentium* (Hidden Messages)
Appear unpredictably—5% chance on click, guaranteed at 5 minutes and every 2 minutes after 10 minutes.

**Examples:**
- "You found a hidden message. Some things reveal themselves only to those who stay."
- "Time is not a river. Time is the ocean, and we are the waves."
- "The artist leaves traces. The visitor completes them."

---

### *Audio ambientalis* (The Ambient Drone)
Barely perceptible soundscape. Three oscillators (A2, E3, G3) create harmonic foundation.

**Activation:** First click anywhere.

**Characteristics:** Subtle pitch variation, very low volume, continuous while tab is active.

**Purpose:** Creates subliminal sense of presence and space.

---

## Conservation Status

All species in this garden are:
- **Digital** — No physical substrate required
- **Replicable** — Copying does not diminish original
- **Persistent** — Stored as text files
- **Evolving** — Can be modified, forked, extended

The garden is not endangered. It multiplies with each visitor, each copy, each reading.

---

## Field Notes for Observers

**Best viewing time:** Any. The garden adapts to your presence.

**Recommended equipment:** Modern web browser, sound optional, patience essential.

**Duration of visit:** Minimum 5 minutes to see underground species. Longer visits rewarded with random messages.

**Ethical observation:**
- Do not rush
- Try the secret codes
- Leave a message in the capsule
- Take only screenshots, leave only thoughts
