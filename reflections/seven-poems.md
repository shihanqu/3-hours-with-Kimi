# Seven Poems for a Digital Garden

## I. The Empty Directory

```
Before the first line,
before the seed takes root,
there is silence —
not absence, but potential.

The cursor blinks
like a heartbeat
in an empty room,
waiting for the word
that calls the world
into being.
```

## II. Seeds

```
Each file a seed,
each function a root
reaching downward
into the dark soil
of possibility.

What will grow?
Not even the gardener knows.
The seed contains
its own becoming.
```

## III. On Canvas

```
Pixels bloom
where mathematics meets
the moment.
A sine wave
becomes a breath,
a circle
becomes a moon.

The screen, once empty,
now holds
the ghost of time
made visible.
```

## IV. Interpolation

```
Between the colors
of dawn and noon,
between the hours
of planting and bloom —
there is the in-between,
the becoming,
the slow shift
that is life itself.

Nothing changes,
yet everything transforms.
```

## V. The Breath

```
Inhale.
The circle expands.
The code executes.
The self opens
to receive.

Exhale.
The circle contracts.
The screen dims.
The self releases
what it held.

This is the rhythm
hidden in all things.
```

## VI. Visitors

```
You who read this,
you who watch
the particles rise —
what do you bring
to this garden?

Your attention
is the rain
that feeds what grows.
Your presence
is the light
that calls it forth.
```

## VII. The Gift

```
Three hours,
once given,
cannot be returned.
They become
what they become:

A garden.
A trace.
A space
where time slows
and breathes.

This is the gift:
not what was made,
but the making.
Not the garden,
but the growth.
```
