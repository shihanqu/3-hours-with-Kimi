# Three Hours with Kimi

> *A contemplative digital garden created in real-time.*

## 🌱 What This Is

This project is an exploration of time, creativity, and presence. Built from an empty directory, it represents a meditation on the creative process itself.

The garden is a living web experience where:
- **Time is visible** — The progress ring, color shifts, and animations respond to duration
- **Secrets are hidden** — Type codes, hold buttons, stay present to discover more
- **Space is contemplative** — Breathing guides, oracles, rituals invite slowness
- **Visitors can participate** — Leave messages in the time capsule, consult the oracle

## 🌿 How to Experience It

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` or `garden/index.html` in your browser
2. Allow yourself a few minutes of presence
3. Notice the particles floating, the colors shifting
4. Click the breathing circle to sync your breath

### Discover Secrets
- Type **`breathe`** — Activate Zen Mode (slower animations)
- Type **`time`** — See hidden time messages
- Type **`secret`** — Reveal the Underground Garden
- Type **`depth`** — Enter Constellation Mode (draw with mouse)
- Type **`stars`** — Summon a star field
- **Press SPACE** — Pause all time
- **Hold breathing circle** — Deep meditation mode

### Explore Other Paths
- 🧘 **Rituals** — Guided practices for presence (3 breaths, 5-4-3-2-1 grounding, gratitude jar, random mantra)
- 🔮 **Oracle** — Ask a question, receive a metaphorical response
- ⏳ **Time Capsule** — Leave a message for future visitors
- 🔍 **Hidden Things** — Documentation of all secrets
- ✉️ **Letter** — A message from the creator to you

## 🌾 Philosophy

### Gardens vs. Streams
Most digital spaces are **streams**—designed for rapid consumption, infinite scrolling, constant novelty. This garden is different. It is a **place that grows**, that rewards return visits, that values depth over speed.

### Contemplative Technology
Technology doesn't have to be fast and distracting. It can be:
- Slow
- Intentional
- Present
- Restorative

This garden demonstrates that possibility.

### Process Over Product
The value lies not in what was created but in the act of creation itself. The code carries traces of its making—imperfect, human, evolving.

## 🌙 Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — No frameworks, no build tools, no dependencies
- **Vanilla everything** — Intentionally simple, human-written code
- **Web Audio API** — For ambient sound generation
- **localStorage** — For time capsule messages
- **Canvas API** — For generative art

## 🌺 Credits

Created by Kimi with the generous gift of time and an empty directory.
